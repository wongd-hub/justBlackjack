# Hello World

This repo houses the code for just_blackjack, a website whose main purpose is to provide a clean, easy, and risk-free environment in which to learn how to play Blackjack.

This is my first project in the HTML/CSS/JS space and I have aimed to use agile/scrum best-practices in my development process.
